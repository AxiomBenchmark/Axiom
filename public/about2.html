            <h2>Idea</h2>
            <p>Since we were looking for a way to time how different frameworks perform on different devices, we looked around to find a platform agnostic way to test JavaScript. Unfortunately, we did not find a website that did what we were looking to do, so we created one called Axiom.  Axiom benchmarks the performance of JavaScript using our testing application which runs lifecycle and object tests to show how well different frameworks perform on a device. These results are placed into a searchable database that can be explored on our results page. This allows users to compare how different frameworks perform on their device or how well a framework works across devices. Moreover, Axiom is designed to run on all devices including desktop, mobile, and televisions. To that end, the UI is designed to be friendly to all devices and includes tools to make it television friendly and mobile friendly. </p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a vital and overarching component of modern interactive websites. While HTML and CSS make up the look and feel of a website, JavaScript provides the interactive aspects and can alter HTML and CSS to make a web page change after the page loads. A modern web browser includes a JavaScript engine, a runtime tool that executes JavaScript that is loaded into it. Interactions between running JavaScript code and the web page are handled by the browser as Document Object Model, or DOM, updates that change the structure and contents of the page.</p>
            <p>However, JavaScript lacks object-oriented features that would make sites faster and more organized. Web frameworks, built on top of plain JavaScript, take advantage of class-like functionality and organization while providing optimizing features that atomically update elements when necessary. Each framework has a distinct lifecycle that can be tracked to measure performance. These frameworks are compiled into plain JavaScript before running in the browser. The purpose of Axiom is to profile the performance of these compiled applications.</p>
            <p>Given the nature of JavaScript’s execution, there exists several roadblocks to its testability. Since browser-side JavaScript is destined for multiple browsers on many platforms, the browser hides many extra details that most sites don’t need in order to execute. For example, few websites would ask how much memory is available, working under the assumption that the website should use the least amount of memory possible and work from there. Nefarious uses of JavaScript are also widespread, so it is in the user’s best interest to hide any details about the JavaScript engine’s implementation.</p>
            <p>However, developers still need to access these engine secrets when developing and debugging their applications. Typically, this is accomplished using browser extensions that have access to the core metrics provided by the browser. One of the most common is Chrome Developer Tools for the Google Chrome browser. By having direct access to the JavaScript engine on the device, it provides a transparent view of the engine as it runs a website. However, this solution relies on running Google Chrome on a device that supports Chrome Developer Tools and is far from platform agnostic. Axiom is able to run regardless of the browser and possibly supply webhooks so that information from similar tools can still be useful if supported.</p>
            <p>There are several JavaScript libraries that attempt to do performance analytics such as Benchmark.js. These tools do not rely on browser extensions, and thus do fit the requirements of cross platform capability.</p>
            <p>In addition to being barred from using browser specific devices, being truly cross platform means that all code must be able to run on all browsers. To this end, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) publishes a specification of HTML that all browsers must be able to support to be considered  a browser. This specification was used as a guide so that the code we created was truly cross platform. Moreover, to make our site even more cross platform, the site is also designed for use in televisions. Unlike desktop and mobile, televsion friendly apps must be navigable with a remote. Most remotes use arrow keys to navigate across a screen. The our site is able to navigate using the arrow keys.</p>

            <h2>Open Source</h2>
            <p>In order to allow others to contribute to our project and have others verify our results, we decided to release it as an open source project via GitHub. Our git repository is located on the homepage.</p>
            <p>This allows developers to use our tools to add tests for frameworks that they want to see as a part of the project. We have provided a template on our git so that developers can achieve similar results for their devices.</p>
